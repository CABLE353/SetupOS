# Welcome to SetupOS!!! #




Hello! CABLE53 here. These are the instructions & some quick details on how to use what I like to call a "simpler and primitive reverse pixie booting without the PXE"üòÅ (trust me it's all offline and safe) to install the Windows 11 OS on multiple PC's quickly, & help to hopefully better compete with the macOS DFU deployment (you're welcome MCRSFTüôÑ). SetupOS was originally built & tested within Windows 11, but since Windows 10 is similar, I'm also including that OS as supported probably even though it's dying in 2025, **but its behaviour hasn't been tested**.


## Intro & How It Works ##

With PXE booting starting to fall out of fashion due to security issues, CEO issues, & whatnot; I've decided to take matters into my own hands and revive this functionality in a different, but simple and rather primitive way. It all runs natively inside the WindowsPE environment, offline (if you want it to), and you can boot right into it using either the Installation Media provided by ms itself **or** the establishment you work for. The SetupOS script(Via the ```wpeshl.ini``` file in the Installation Media) is able to load as WindowsPE boots up. When the script starts, it will run a few commands to essentially "point" the Client PC to the Host PC.

The 1st one finds what the USB Drive mounted to, and runs the setup.exe from the USB drive in case you need to do it that way.

The 2nd initializes the network card a few times using the ```wpeutil InitializeNetwork \NoWait``` command. The ```\NoWait``` flag is set to initialize the card without the painfully long wait of the command also checking for an internet connection by default.**Note: Some PC's have a tendancy to be stubborn with this step and it may take you a couple retries to initialize the network card.**

The 3rd & final command will display the output of the ```ipconfig``` command, & a ```pause``` will be executed afterwards to give users a chance to view the output of the ```ipconfig``` command to make sure that the Client can see the Host(important) before it continues. After any key is pressed, then it will ```cls``` & finally load into the DLA menu explained more below.

I also made sure that in each ```.bat``` or ```.vbs``` file, each command is explained; & if you don't like something(or get suspicious about anythingüò•), well since it's just command prompt, you're free to open notepad or whatever & edit/lookover/examine this stuff to learn what it does in more detail before you use it; I have nothing to hide.

I'm a bit of a newbe, so please be patient. This is my first ever GitHub release. This all took me a few months to update & grind out but I finally got a working concept; albeit a little touchy, but it works; & it's something cool that I wanted to share to whomever might really want/need it for mass Windows Deployment.

If you choose(_not recomended_) to share an internet connection with the Host PC & allowing that connection through to the Switch you plan to plug your Client PC's into, let it be known _**HERE**_ that depending on how many computers & ports you plan to have, an IP address will have to be assigned to each Client. Plan for alot of network mapping/traffic since this program points to files & installation media on the Host PC & transfers it through to the client via an ethenet cable(or WiFi hopefully coming soon).



# Getting Started #

## Download and run the Enviornment Setup Batch file ##
Please refer to [**Step 3b**](https://github.com/CABLE353/SetupOS/tree/main#:~:text=share%20folder%20properties.-,Step%203b%3A,-Go%20to%20Settings) of the manual setup instructions before using the ```enviroset.bat``` file to setup your enviornment.

[```enviroset.bat```](https://github.com/CABLE353/SetupOS/raw/refs/heads/main/enviroset.bat)
[```enviroset-win10.bat```](https://github.com/CABLE353/SetupOS/raw/refs/heads/main/enviroset-win10.bat)
You can download it by right clicking on the file & saving the "link" as a file. Be sure to run the windows 10 version as administrator.

If you have any issues or experience any bugs, please report them and then maybe give the [**Manual Setup Instructions**](https://github.com/CABLE353/SetupOS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-setup-instructions) a tryüôè.

## Tools You'll Need ##

A Host PC _running Windows 10 or later_(the computer that will host all of the installation media files & folders offline).

A USB Drive that _You Have_ that's used for booting installation media(It has to be OS installer files you own of course).

A network switch or wherever you can find a ton of ethernet ports for your Host PC(Wifi support Coming soon hopefully).

Ethernet cables to the amount of ports your computer and/or switch can take.

Chargers for each type of Windows machine(Recomended).

The ability to have a network share folder(Offline share of course if you so choose).

The files in this SetupOS Package folder.

Either DISM Gui 4.0 or NTLite if you decide to take the manual approach to setting up your environment(both of which I _**do not**_ own).
 
Patience.

And some PC's needing a fresh install of Windows 10/11.



## Meeting The Files & Folders ##

```setupos.bat```: I help point the Client PC's in the right direction. I'm located on the USB Installation Media drive inside the ```boot.wim``` image file.

```jobOps.bat```: I display a list of many job Options that you may need, from the Automated Windows 11 Setup to Wiping Surplus Machines. I'm located on the Host PC's ```Win11``` folder. You can also add more jobs to the job list I have!

```vbsbridge.bat```: I'm just a bridge between ```jobOps.bat``` & test2.vbs. I'm also located on the Host PC "Win11" folder.

```autosetup.vbs```: I run the setup.exe file with a little flare...I do every keystroke for you! The last time you should be touching anything is when you choose the Automated Setup option in ```jobOps.bat```. I'm also located in the ```Win11``` folder.

```vacuum.bat```: I'm the one that runs diskpart for your Surplus Machine wiping needs. I live in the ```Win11``` folder too!

```Win11 Folder```: I store the files on the Host PC in a network share accessible via the net use command inside the ```SetupOS.bat``` file!

```SetupOSPackages.zip```: I carry all of the files you'll meet from this github page to your Downloads folder; or wherever you choose to put me. If you're using ```enviroset.bat``` to set up your environment, keep me in the same directory as ```enviroset.bat```.

```Enviroset.bat```: I'm basically the installer. If you choose, you can set it up without me & do it yourself manually using the instructions below, but I do save time & make things easier. I live wherever you choose to put the ```SetupOSPackages.zip``` file as we're kind of a Package deal! If you want to see how I setup the environment for you, feel free to open me up in notepad to get a more detailed view of what I do.

```winpeshl.ini```: You've probably heard of me before if you know how the Windows Installation Media works. I'm basically a "more secure" fancy script file to an executable that runs when the USB drive boots up. I call ```setupOS.bat``` to run at boot; & I'm located inside the ```boot.wim``` image on the USB drive as well.

```usb.txt```: I'm a variable that tells ```enviroset.bat``` where the USB Drive is.

```NAMEOFYOURPC.txt```: I'm a variable that gets the name of your Host PC & uses that name when the Client attempts to connect to the Host. I'm in the Windows\System32 directory of the ```boot.wim``` image file.

```yourUsername.txt```: I'm a variable too, I get stored inside the Windows\System32 directory of the ```boot.wim``` image file. I store your Host PC's username, when the Client connects to the Host to access the ```Win11``` folder & its contents.

```yourPassword.txt```: I'm the variable that stores your Host PC's password, & help ```setupOS.bat``` succefully access the ```Win11``` folder on the Host PC. I live in the Windows\System32 directory of the ```boot.wim``` image file as well.


## Manual Setup Instructions ##
**Please note that Step 3b of the manual setup instructions needs to be used for the ```enviroset.bat``` automatic setup as well.**
If the ```enviroset.bat``` file isn't working for whatever reason (cough cough Powershell cough & admin rights cough), then you can try these manual setup steps:

**Step 1:**   Start your Host PC with an internet connection to run software updates, then when updates are done unplug or disconnect it from the internet, and create a folder named ```Win11```, in your user folder on the C drive(System Drive).

**Step 2:**  Copy ALL USB installation media contents to your newly created folder ```Win11```.

**Step 3a:**   Share this folder & its contents to the Everyone group in the network share folder properties.

**Step 3b**:  Go to ```Settings>Advanced Network Settings>Advanced Sharing Settings```, and switch off the "Password Protection" option underneath the "All Networks" dropdown since Windows 11 at the time of writting is still going through some design changes away from the traditional tools & settings by slowly moving all or most of the settings out of Control Panel, & either putting them into the Settings Applet or turning them into their own Applets. The communication with this setting is a little weird with the Network Share side of things, so while the Applet switch is off it is still enabled in the system & will function as if the switch is still on. If the Applet switch isn't turned off, then when the "net use" command is run, it won't accept the correct password to access the installation files on the Host PC, as it thinks it's always an incorrect password(I have no idea why or how this is, but it isü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

**Step 4:**   Proceed to connect a network switch to your computer via Ethernet cable(Switch<-->Host PC). DO NOT PLUG YOUR SWITCH/SWITCHES INTO THE INTERNET NETWORK UNLESS YOU'VE _THUROUGHLY_ PLANNED FOR IT!

**Step 5:**   Connect as many Ethernet Cables that your switch can handle(You may also daisy chain switches or aquire a giant switch to get more Ethernet ports).

**Setp 6a:**   To run SetupOS upon booting the USB drive, mount the boot.wim file in either DISM GUI 4.0 or NTLite. If you're using DISM GUI 4.0, then before you mount the image, put the index number dropdown menu to 2, & then mount it. For NTLite, click on the usb drive letter mount dropdown, & in the list of available images NTLite found in the usb device, double click on the boot.wim image with the index of 2 associated with its dropdown mounting options.

**Step 6c:**   Create the following files using the network name, local username, & password of the Host PC:
```NAMEOFYOURPC.txt```
```yourUsername.txt```
```yourPassword.txt```

**Step 6c:**   Copy these files from the SetupOSPackage folder to the mounted folder directory of the ```boot.wim``` drive in ```Windows\System32```, then unmount & commit the boot.wim image in either DISM GUI 4.0 or NTLite:
```setupos.bat```
```winpeshl.ini``` (If you already have a ```winpeshl.ini``` file in your Install Media, then just copy & paste the contents of this file into the one already there)
```NAMEOFYOURPC.txt```
```yourUsername.txt```
```yourPassword.txt```

**Step 7:**   Copy these files into the "SetupOS Package" folder, to your newly created folder "Win11": 
```jobOps.bat```
```autosetup.vbs```
```vbsbridge.bat```
```vacuum.bat``` 

**Notice:**   Some of the "net use" lines inside the setupOS.bat file don't have the username & password integration because some PC's won't store credentials due to policies that are set depending on the configuration of the Client PC that you're putting Windows on, so those options are there so you can enter them in manually if needs be. The fields are _**CASE SENSITIVE**_.

Congrats!! Your setup should now be ready to wheel-and-deal the Installation of Windows 11 & run other custom scripts, programs, & tools that you'll need to execute!


## Using The Setup ##

**Step 1:**  Connect as many Client PC's as you have Ethernet cables & chargers.

**Step 2:**  Boot each Client PC from the USB Installation Media.

**Step 3:**  If you plan to use the native functions of the installation media, simply minimize the SetupOS window, & carry on normally.

**Step 6:**  The ```setupOS.bat``` file will first initialize the network card in the Client PC, after it does, it will then run an ```ipconfig``` command to check if the Client PC sees the Host PC. If no output is returned, then the cable has not been initialized or found, & you'll need to check every connection(if you have a switch make sure to check the power cord) to make sure that the Host PC & the Client PC are connected, then the ```setupOS.bat``` file needs to be re-run(Press r to re-run the program from Step 5), if a "Media disconnected" is returned it means that the Client PC Network Card hasn't found the Host PC and this will also need a re-run of the ```setupOS.bat``` program until it does. If the ```ipconfig``` returns an ipv4 address(usually starts with "255.") then the Client PC has found the Host PC and you can continue the program by pressing c. Entering nothing into this prompt will terminate the script entirely.

**Step 7:**  You've made it to the DLA Menu(confetti & popper noises)!!!! The DLA Menu is, & stands for, Drive Letter Assosiation. Each Client PC will need to mount the Host PC "Win11" folder to a drive letter. Each of the drive letters cannot be chosen twice during the installation process. There are some options with credential integration and some without. This is explained above in the Setup Instructions Step 8.

**Step 8:**  After you've chosen one of the drive letter mounts, you may now choose from the jobs provided in the ```jobOps.bat``` menu. When this menu appears, you can yank the USB drive out & start on the next Client PC. If a window pops up and closes with no menu appearing, check the connection between the Client PC, Switch, Host PC, & the power cable connection to your Switch, then just choose the option again. If no menu appears restart the setupOS program & test the connection. If that doesn't work, check every connection that hooks up the Host PC & Client PC together.

**Step 9:**  Now you can choose a job on each Client PC & boom! You've successfully started your 1st batch using SetupOS!


## Extra Things To Note ##

The Windows 11 Automated Setup keystrokes every mouse click for you & using diskpart, **_deletes the previous OS_** to do a clean install. If you don't want to do a clean install, then don't run the Windows 11 Automated Setup. Please note that if anything is touched during this part of the process, it WILL put those keystrokes where you don't want them and there is NO WAY to stop it(like ctrl+C works for .bat files) as far as my knowledge takes me. You don't have to touch the Client PC again _until_ it boots to the OOBE(Out Of Box Experience) setup options _after_ Windows installs(like keyboard layout, picking a network, & checking for updates).

The 2nd option available (Automated DiskPart) is for mass wiping any PC's that you might have to do for whatever reason.

The 3rd option allows you to go through the Windows 11 setup settings manually if you need to.

The 4th option is well _Your choice_! Yes that's right! If you know a little bit of cmd scripting(or know how to do your research), you can add whatever & however many custom options you want to this file & it will appear with the rest of the othersüòâ.


## Closure ##

Thanks for getting through all of that, if you have any questions I guess just submit stuff on the Issues Page. I guess one could say that this entire project is basically scripts calling other scripts to do scripty things that you decide to scriptüòÇ.

If you're really really really tech savy(your 2nd language just so happens to be cmd lingo) and you know what I'm doing(or trying to doüòÅ) in this program, & want to help make this process better & more stable either just for you or for everyone, then feel free to just change what you want in your environment, & maybe hopefully possibly share your creation by forking SetupOS üòâ.

Also please understand that what _**YOU**_ do with this tool is **_YOUR_** responsibility. I can't be held liable for **_ANY_** misuse or casual & unsecure operations or configurations of this tool.

Please be sure to leave feedback! I would love to know if anybody likes it.

I hope this thing helps someone out there in the deployment world.
Enjoy!!!
