# Welcome to SetupOSBeta!!! #




Hello! CABLE53 here. This is the beta version where features are added but not tested. I've branched it out of main so that I can do edits here, & add new features, & then once tested a commit will be pushed to main.
Enjoy!!!


# New Features List #
WiFi integration.
UI changes to implement the new WiFi structure.
